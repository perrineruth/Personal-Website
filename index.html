			I am a graduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park majoring in applied mathematics (AMSC). My Ph.D. advisor is <a href="https://www.math.umd.edu/~mariakc/">Maria Cameron</a>
			where we are studying the application of random graph theory to steady state reactive dynamics. My research interests primarily lie in graph theory and its application to scientific problems.
			These interests extend to other topics that are applicable to complex systems such as control theory and dynamical systems.
